# jazzkid nvim config mk.3

Lightweight nvim config. Structured for easy tailoring.

> Note: The more customised, heavier config that I currently work with is in the `avante` branch.
> The main addition is [avante.nvim](http://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim), which provides AI-powered code assistance.
> It also features an improved completion plugin, via [blink.cmp](https://github.com/Saghen/blink.cmp).

Recently removed Mason (an automated lsp installer).
It's easier for noobs but lsps should exist separately from the editor imo.

Consider removing ./lua/custom/ and ./lua/keymaps.lua if you're starting from scratch.

I used [kickstart-modular.nvim](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim) as a starting point. 
If you're new, I'd recommend starting there.
