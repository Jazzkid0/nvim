# jazzkid nvim config 
## mk.3 true ending edition
 
Lightweight nvim config. Structured for easy tailoring.

Consider removing ./lua/custom/ and ./lua/keymaps.lua if you're starting from scratch.

One major change is that I don't use Mason.
It's easier for noobs but lsps should exist separately from the editor imo.


I used [kickstart-modular.nvim](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim) as a starting point. 
If you're new, I'd recommend starting there.
