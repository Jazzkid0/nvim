# jazzkid nvim config mk.3

Lightweight nvim config. Structured for easy tailoring.

Recently removed Mason (an automated lsp installer). 
It's easier for noobs but lsps should exist separately from the editor imo.

Consider removing ./lua/custom/ and ./lua/keymaps.lua if you're starting from scratch.

I used [kickstart-modular.nvim](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim) as a starting point. 
If you're new, I'd recommend starting there.
